My research explores human behavior and cognition during the design process, especially when faciliated by AI-enabled systems. I am interested in answering how AI support for design can be effectively developed and employed, drawing on insights from empirical human subject studies and cognitive psychology and neuroscience.   

# Publications

{% assign yeartest = true %} {% for publi in site.data.publist %} {% if publi.year %}{% else %} {% assign yeartest = false %} {% endif %} {% endfor %}

{% if yeartest == false %}
