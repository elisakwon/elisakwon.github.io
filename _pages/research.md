#### Using AI to enable and investigate novel human-machine interactions in design
  
Leveraging deep learning and AI in human-machine interfaces for design, I am interested in studying how these systems enable new interactions to support design and impact designer behavior. I have previously explored this topic by developing a multi-modal platform allowing designers to search for 3D-model parts to inspire ideas in a design task, by engaging novel interaction modalities. Beyond text-based inputs, our platform enabled search for related parts based on non-semantic relationships, such as visual and functional similarities defined using deep learning. Through two human-subject experiments and using mixed-methods approaches, we found how these new interactions afforded different search behaviors, and were differently exploited by novice compared to professional designers.
