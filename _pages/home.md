# Welcome! 

Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert in the <a href="http://codesign.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab</a>. I previously received my BASc in Engineering Science (2017) and MASc in Mechanical Engineering (2019) at the University of Toronto in the <a href="[http://shulab.utoronto.ca](https://shulab.mie.utoronto.ca/)/" target="_blank">Behavior-Informed Design Lab (BIDLAB)</a>, led by Dr. Li Shu. 

I am interested in how humans use computational design tools to support conceptual engineering design using a variety of methodological approaches at the intersection of cognition, computation, and engineering design theory. My work has been published across numerous international design conferences and engineering design journals. **Please see my past and current research!** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications) **!**
