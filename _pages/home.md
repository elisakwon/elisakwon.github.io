# About me 

Hello! I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Toronto, with Dr. Alison Olechowski in the <a href="https://readylab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Ready Lab</a>. I recently completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert in the <a href="http://codesign.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab</a> at UC Berkeley. Previously, I received my BASc in Engineering Science (2017) and MASc in Mechanical Engineering (2019) at the University of Toronto in the <a href="https://shulab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Design Effectiveness Lab (DELAB)</a>, led by Dr. Li Shu. My research has been funded by NSERC through the postdoctoral fellowship (PDF) and postgraduate scholarship (PGS-D).  

I am interested in how humans interact and collaborate with AI in design-support tools that augment human ability in conceptual engineering design. I use a variety of methodological approaches in my research at the intersection of cognition, computation, and engineering design theory. My work has been published across numerous international design conferences and engineering design journals. **Please see my past and current [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications) !**
