# About me 

Hello! I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley (expected completion: December 2024), under the supervision of Dr. Kosa Goucher-Lambert in the <a href="http://codesign.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Cognition and Computation in Design (Co-Design) Lab</a>. I previously received my BASc in Engineering Science (2017) and MASc in Mechanical Engineering (2019) at the University of Toronto in the <a href="https://shulab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Design Effectiveness Lab (DELAB)</a>, led by Dr. Li Shu. I look forward to beginning a postdoc at the University of Toronto with Dr. Alison Olechowski in the <a href="https://readylab.mie.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank">Ready Lab</a> in January 2025! 

I am interested in how humans interact and collaborate with AI in design-support tools that support conceptual engineering design. I use a variety of methodological approaches in my research at the intersection of cognition, computation, and engineering design theory. My work has been published across numerous international design conferences and engineering design journals. **Please see my past and current [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications) !**
